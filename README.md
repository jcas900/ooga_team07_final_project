This project contains multiple versions of the game of Monopoly, dynamically rendered based on user created data files.  The versions can be created via a new data file or through the in game editor.  I (Jordan Castleman) worked along with four other teammates to create this project; I was a critical part of the design phase and implemented a significant amount of the backend.  

Names: Jordan Castleman, Aaric Han, William Convertino, Casey Goldstein, and Henry Huynh
